# Explain the differences between the sample and population variance
print("The difference between the sample and population variance is due to the estimation of the population variance from the sample variance. 
       The sample variance is a biased estimator of the population variance, meaning that it tends to overestimate the population variance. 
       To correct for this bias, the sample variance is divided by (n - 1) instead of n, where n is the sample size.")
