# machine_learning
All the basic codes in machine learning covering predictions, classifications and more.
This repository is more about complex codes broken down into small bite-sized chunks for easier implementation.
Most datasets have been taken up from the seasborn or sklearn libraries and only a handful are picked up from Kaggle.
Codes can smoothly across all platforms but Google Colab and Jypter and are personal choices when working online.
Make sure to learn about libraries and functions as and when they pop up.
Any suggestions for improvements are highly appreciated.
Hope you have fun!
